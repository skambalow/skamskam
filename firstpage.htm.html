                <p><strong>Happy 10th Monthsarry, my love!</strong></p>
                <p>10 months. Tagal na, ha? Ikaw kasi e. "Ako na naman", malamang ikaw. Sino ba unang humalik? 'Di ba ikaw? Oh, edi pangatawanan mo. HAHAHAHAHSHSHSHSHSHS</p>
                <p>Jokes aside, I'm very happy to see you bloom when I'm at your side and I can't wait to stargaze upon my beautiful flower, into a strong, tall, and independent tree. "I will raise you so high that every man on Earth is now doomed to live in your shadows". Just remember, that even if all the other guys are doomed beneath you, I will stay with you forever as your one and only Jay.</p>
                <p>Hihintayin ko pang ma-excite kada pag-uwi ko kasi masisilayan ko na naman kayo ni Kuya Ace and Bb Jaira, ha? Kaya stay strong, hon. For I will be you wine when you're thirsty, and you're my bread when I'm hungry.</p>
                <p>I'm always proud of you!! Papa will always be proud for every achievements you got. I will do my very best to be with you during those times. Nandito lang din ako kung gusto mo ng unan na kayakap. Tawagin mo kaya akong "Pillows", 'no? P'wede 'yung food, p'wede rin 'yung unan talaga. Sweet, hard but soft inside, fluffy, and most importantly, can and will always listen to you.</p>
                <p>I love you, my mochi, cinnamonroll, Yan, YanYan, love, luv, lab, luvluv, babe, bb, baby, babyloves, princess, queen, Enaira, ma,  and mama. I love you, my Ariane Janel Puzon Felix. Happy 10th Monthsarry!</p>
                <p style="color:Tomato;">—sincerely yours, Jay.</p>
